2. PRIVATE KEY FILE (for re-enrollment):
   🔑 admin_system_admin_private.pem
   
3. DEVICE SECRET (from file):
   🔐 911313
   (also in: admin_device_secret.txt)

========================================

1. Go to the login page
2. Upload the CERTIFICATE file: admin_system_admin_certificate.pem
3. Click "Need to re-enroll secure keys?" to show additional fields
4. Upload the PRIVATE KEY file: admin_system_admin_private.pem
5. Enter the DEVICE SECRET: 911313

========================================
IMPORTANT NOTES:
========================================

- The .pem file is your CERTIFICATE (upload first)
